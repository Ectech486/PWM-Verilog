# PWM-Verilog
Generator creates a 10MHz PWM signal with variable duty cycle

**=> What is Pulse Width Modulation? :-** 
Pulse width modulation reduces the average power delivered by an electrical signal by converting the signal into discrete parts. In the PWM technique, the signalâ€™s energy is distributed through a series of pulses rather than a continuously varying (analogue) signal.
